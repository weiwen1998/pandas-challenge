Based on the findings for PyCitySchools, I am able to come with two relevant conclusions:

•	We can observe that the overall passing score consisting of mathematics and reading scores, are higher in charter schools compared to district schools. If we were to compare both math and reading percentage scores, the passing score percentage for reading is higher than the passing score percentage for math.
•	We also can observe that those schools with a lower spending range would have a higher passing score for each category (average mathematics and reading scores, and percentage of students with a passing score of mathematics, reading and overall), and as the spending range gets larger, all of these scores diminish.
